Project Title: 
Stock market prediciton using ML Concept and Python 

Abstracts:
This project is about learning about stock market data sets and how the variation in stock market is happening.So basically taking raw data set and then analyzing the data("structure,data type),then moulding the data in same data type.Then we are applying preprocessing techinique like data cleaning(like removal of null values in raw data).Then we select one data model(LSTM model) in which we will convert the data for training purpose.Then we train the model.Now the model knows how the data is fluctuating.So now we take another new data set,and according to that our model will predict the values as per our requirement.



Brief:
So basically,
i'm using ML concepts like,
firstly taking raw data then getting to know about information of data,like structure of data and it's type.
Then i'm applying Data preprocessing concept,like data cleaning ,removing the null entries from raw data,rescaling the data,standardize the data(converting into same data type),etc.
Then after the data is in standard for i'll take the data for analysis,now the data variation will be observed by the model by fully observing the raw data.Like at how much duration the stock market of a particular item is varying.
This will generate our RNN model(LSTM(long short-term model)).
LSTM is just a RNN(recurrent neural network) which is used in deep learning.
So,till here our training is done.
Now we will take a raw data for which we want prediction.We will give the desired date(day,month,year) for the duration we want the prediction.
Now our trained model will predict the values.
